# Dotfiles
My Current Tech Stack
- Arch Linux
- i3
- Polybar
- Rofi
- Alacritty
- Bash (Might Switch to zsh not sure)
- Neovim
- Dunst

Feel free to use these configs as you see fit, this repo is mostly for me to save my own files between machines.
The perculair folder setup is because I use GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles.
